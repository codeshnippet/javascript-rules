0: The second presentation is about JavaScript.
This presentation is again split into 3 parts: What? Why? and How?

1: And the What? of this presentation is JavaScript.
But not only JavaScript, also 2 of the many technologies that come along: NodeJS and React.

2: What do we know about JS?
It was originally designed to make web pages more dynamic.
Netscape was one of the first browsers to support JavaScipt.
Later on JavaScript appeared on server side. And with creation of NodeJS it became a very popular option for SS.
We know that you can also develop for mobiles with JS. React Native and other technologies give you that.
Another new trendy thing is Internet of Things devices.
And you can also develop apps for the voice controlled devices.

3: Why should we care about all that?
To have fun of course. We are engineers and should enjoy our skills from time to time.
Question is, how hard it is?

4: DEMO. This is what I wanted to find out. And after a presentation on WebDevCon,
I decided to try my beginner level JS skills to build couple of apps.
